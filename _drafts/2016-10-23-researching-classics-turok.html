I recently found out Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is on Steam. I bought it in a fit of nostalgia and..."research". That last bit is only partially in jest. Games from the N64 and PS2 era are my main inspiration, so there really is some research to do. Though I already remember and have designed the features I want that are inspired by these games, it's good to have one of the games again to play and see for myself.
