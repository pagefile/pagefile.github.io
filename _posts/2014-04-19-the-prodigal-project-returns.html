I've cleaned up the github repository for my Unity game project, Infinity Defense. I think I'm closer to a prototype than I was when I put it down a year ago, which is kind of exciting to think about actually. I might end up actually branching it into two game prototypes though. The original idea for Infinity Defense will stay. It's going to be a wave based shooter where the goal is to survive as long as you can defending an objective and try to get a high score. You fly around a plane/ship type thing with awesome weapons and make awesome explosions. It'd be great if I could end up shipping it on mobile or something, but for now I just want to make the game.<br /><br />The new idea is a sort of Starfoxish shmup. I got the idea after recently playing the trench run in Halo 4 (which was an awesome level) and just flying around in my prototype for Infinity Defense. I'm not sure if It'll have rail sections or not, but I want free flying sections, maybe for huge boss fights. This idea really doesn't have anything concrete besides "The spaceship section of Halo 4 was awesome!" but I want to try to get that feel for this game.<br /><br />For now I'm using Unity assets and placeholder assets from <a href="http://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt.org</a>. It's an awesome site for anyone looking for art and sound assets, whether for placeholders or final shipping. The assets are under plenty of licenses so it shouldn't be hard to find something for your need.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/p2NatjeHFTU" width="560"></iframe>
