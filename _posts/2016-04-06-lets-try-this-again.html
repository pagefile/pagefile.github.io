So that whole dev blog attempt last time didn't get very far. I figure I'll try again. This time with a shooter in Unreal.<br /><br />It's not just a mindless shooter (although I am going to make one of those along the way to familiarize myself with game flow in the engine). It's a game inspired by Perfect Dark and Goldeneye 007. What I really liked about those games is you were given a mission. A spy mission. And you weren't handed a bunch of waypoints to follow like bread crumbs. It felt like you were actually infiltrating because the objectives weren't just handed to you on a silver platter.<br /><br />One of the things I would like to do is have non-mission critical objectives change how future missions play. As an example, say there's a mainframe in one of the missions you can bug. It's not a mission critical objective, but if you do, perhaps in the next missions or a few down the line you get extra intel to help complete the mission. Or maybe you were unable to stop a baddie from getting away with some high tech prototype. Later on enemies might start using mass produced versions of the tech that got stolen. If you recover it instead, you get to use it for yourself.<br /><br />This is all just design right now though. I currently just have a sandbox to learn things in Unreal and play around with the engine. The biggest hurdle seems to be little caveats the engine has that slow me down. Hopefully though once I learn all of those development will go smoother. At the very least, I would get more problems from my own code rather than the engine being itself.
