I dove back into my game again recently. I've decided late nights with no interruptions are the ideal time to work. The only problem is they only come just before days off. Even so I prefer having all that time to work instead of trying to get something done in just an hour or so. Especially when I'm still trying to get all the basic stuff programmed.<br /><br />This time wasn't all fun and games. I spent most of that time trying to figure out a scaling issue. I decided I should try to get all my super programmer art to scale so I don't have to mess with settings when I import them. There's a little problem though.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zK1CbyGnv8E/V-VGwRgX5xI/AAAAAAAAHJQ/FYl1NU40Q2U0lxSGJ4oq4zjYYPJNbCLDQCK4B/s1600/this%2Bis%2Bwrong.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zK1CbyGnv8E/V-VGwRgX5xI/AAAAAAAAHJQ/FYl1NU40Q2U0lxSGJ4oq4zjYYPJNbCLDQCK4B/s400/this%2Bis%2Bwrong.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is wrong</td></tr></tbody></table><div>Actually, it's not a little problem. It's a big problem. It's bigger than the gun. It's bigger than the player. It's probably bigger than the first vehicle I'll implement. Funnily enough, it's about the same size as the bullets it spawns</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3wz3DQuFo20/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3wz3DQuFo20?feature=player_embedded" width="560"></iframe></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">That's not cool. I can't even move forward while firing because I run into the massive bullets. If I had implemented damage already the player character would have died.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">After a bit of Google Fu, the issue seems to lie with the Blender FBX exporter. For the most part it works as needed. But for some reason UE4 wants to make the sockets enormous. I'm not entirely sure what the cause is, but the only solutions I've seen so far have to do with scaling before exporting...which is what I wanted to avoid.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">However, Blender wasn't alone in this. The bullets wouldn't just magically scale themselves to the size of the socket I'm spawning them at unless I'm using the socket's entire transform. Which I was.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-58rhgo3jnSo/V-VIfAPpItI/AAAAAAAAHJc/xHb38ofoXa4LsXbytvTzBUC88CtEsGeAwCK4B/s1600/getMuzzleTransform.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="186" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-58rhgo3jnSo/V-VIfAPpItI/AAAAAAAAHJc/xHb38ofoXa4LsXbytvTzBUC88CtEsGeAwCK4B/s640/getMuzzleTransform.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This quick fix gets rid of the massive bullets, though now I can't see the tracer effect. It's still a huge improvement over the boulder bullets I was firing though. My concern though is that it is just a quick fix. I have no idea how these scaled sockets may affect other systems, if at all. I'm still in early prototyping, so I have time to bumble through these problems and fix them, but it's still a cloud looming overhead.</div></div>
