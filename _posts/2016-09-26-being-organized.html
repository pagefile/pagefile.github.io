I didn't get much done last night through a combination of being sleepy and a lack of a task list. I didn't have a clear direction so I ended up going to bed after adding a new weapon. The good news is adding new weapons is trivial, as it should be. The bad news is being unorganized is a motivation killer.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4shvCt5nm6E/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4shvCt5nm6E?feature=player_embedded" width="560"></iframe></div><br />So now I've decided I need to keep a task list. Even if it's only for a days work, I should write down what I need to do to keep production flowing, or it will stop after a bit of aimlessness. I do like taking pen to paper every now and then, but I don't want to physically store this list somewhere, mainly because it can get lost, so for now I've settled on a simple text file that has the upcoming tasks. I've heard of apps like Trello that'll help track things but for now I want to keep it simple. This is really just to help me refocus after not working a couple of days.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RfRb2crIZy8/V-lmhPET5sI/AAAAAAAAHJs/oCB5RNRP6B47WFnJJ65MlV4zLMYcnv1bQCK4B/s1600/task%2Blist.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RfRb2crIZy8/V-lmhPET5sI/AAAAAAAAHJs/oCB5RNRP6B47WFnJJ65MlV4zLMYcnv1bQCK4B/s1600/task%2Blist.PNG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">My current task list. Simple and easy to digest</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br />Soon enough I am going to have to spend more time designing the more minute details for my game. Right now I have a rough overview in my head as well as a few lists of features, but nothing on the player experience outside the actual gameplay. I'll need to design and program things like menus, settings, and transitions between everything. It's a beast separate from the gameplay that will take up just as much time.<br /><br />I also almost didn't make a post for this, but I decided I want this blog to be as much part of development as coding is, so even if it's something tiny I'll probably make a post about it.
