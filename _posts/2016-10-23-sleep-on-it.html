After taking a bit of a(n unintentional) break I'm diving back into code. The first thing I want to do is add health so anything destructible can take damage and be destroyed. The easiest and plainest jane way to do it is to simply have a number on anything with health. That's boring though. Effective, but boring. If I want, say, a vehicle that's armored, I'd need to just give it a lot of health. And then give it a weakness for anti-armor weapons or something, and then it'd just get complicated because I didn't plan it out. I want to be able to have resistances and weaknesses. That's super cool. It lets me make all sorts of things, like robots that are weak to electricity, or acid weapons that can eat through armor really quick. That takes some work if I want it to be easy to develop for. But then I had an idea. An idea with a bit of inspiration from Overwatch. It's really more inspired from their HUD, because the basic idea has been around forever.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-41PFbZnX3Lk/WAzhvvdjUXI/AAAAAAAAHKQ/8QIu1MrzBe0uaxPH1ESgzIGJohAEtrwZACLcB/s1600/Overwatch%2BHealth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-41PFbZnX3Lk/WAzhvvdjUXI/AAAAAAAAHKQ/8QIu1MrzBe0uaxPH1ESgzIGJohAEtrwZACLcB/s1600/Overwatch%2BHealth.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Health HUD in Overwatch</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In the picture above you can clearly see three different types of hit points. The white is base health. There's nothing special about it. Yellow is armor, which reduces damage by half, but not more than five points per instance of damage. This makes it very effective against "death by a thousand paper cuts" type attacks. The Blue is shields. It has no damage reduction but it recharges after a period of no damage. Shields are also always above armor, so they get damaged first.<br /><div><br /></div><div>In a nut shell, that's exactly the way I want my health system to work. It's going to be a health bar with health pools inside. Each pool has a type (which has it's own weaknesses and resistances) and possibly some special characteristics. Each pool will also have a priority, with the highest priority taking damage first. I could also add other features like damage pass through (say, armor penetrating rounds that deal little armor damage, but will deal some damage to the pool underneath) but I'll save that for later.</div><div><br /></div><div>The difficulty comes in how to implement it. Ideally, this is all stuff I want to be able to manipulate in the editor for any class that has a health bar. I want to be able to create and edit different health pools in the editor and add them to blueprint classes when defining new or objects or whatever. But is the health bar really worthy of being an actor? I can't justify it but it would bring immense convenience to the dev process. I couldn't decide so I decided to sleep on it.</div><div><br /></div><div>And then I discover Actor Components!</div><div><br /></div><div>I mean, I knew they existed, but it didn't register until now that I could (and should) make my own. A health bar would be a perfect component. It also seems that UObjects will show up in the editor, so deriving from that class for the health pools means I should be able to manipulate them in the editor.</div><div><br /></div><div>And with that I've also solved my naming problem. I didn't know what I should call health pools until I typed it in. Rubber ducking at it's finest!</div>
