I participated in Ludum Dare 38 the past weekend. I only got to really work one day, but I'm glad I did it. I'll have a postmortem later, but for now here's the link to my <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/$15860">game's page</a> on <a href="http://ldjam.com/">ldjam.com</a>.<br /><br />I wasn't able to finish, but I decided the only reason to not submit is if I nothing exists to submit. Besides, it's a record of my involvement, I don't want that to disappear.<br /><br />Stay tuned for the postmortem.<br /><br />PS: You should go to <a href="http://ldjam.com/">ldjam.com</a> and check out some of the other games. I haven't had any time to try any of them yet but some of them look really good!
