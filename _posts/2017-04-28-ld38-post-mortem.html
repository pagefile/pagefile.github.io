<a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/battle-toys/a-small-postmortem">I published a short postmortem for LD38 on my user page.</a><br /><br />Copy/Pasted below for convenience:<br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">A quick postmortem for my first time in Ludum Dare. Nothing fancy.</span></div><h2 id="the-first-day"><span font-family:="" font-size:="" inherit="" large="">The first day</span></h2><div style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-top: 0.8em;"><span font-family:="" inherit="">And unfortunately, basically my only day for me. The first thing I learned was the take days off for the game jam. You can get a lot done in one day, but you can get even more done in three days. It’s a crazy though, but I swear it’s true. This happened because I only decided to do this game jam about two weeks before, which isn’t long enough to request days off where I work. Going my next game jam I’ll be much more prepared in this regard.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-top: 0.8em;"><span font-family:="" inherit="">I also found out I had sort of put myself into a design rut, so to speak. Most of my recent efforts have been on designing game mechanics and maybe implementing them. Nothing in regards to tying game systems together, which I actually did a bit of during development of this game. So fortunately that’s something on my mind now which is important if I want to try to release some full games down the line. I’ll be looking to dive more into the engine side of things whenever I get the chance.</span></div><h2 id="moving-forward"><span font-family:="" inherit="">Moving forward</span></h2><div style="margin-top: 0.8em;"><span font-family: inherit;">I wasn’t able to finish my game due to the whole only having one whole day to work on it, but I want to finish what I had in mind, and maybe polish up a bit. Even if the jam is over it’ll be a good exercise and it’ll be a good thing to show off. I’ll also want to dive a bit more into modelling for some more decent programmer art. I know it’s not necessary, but I’d also like to brush up on my modeling skills since I know some possibly outdated basics. It’d also help in making more small games, which I’d like to do more of.</span></div>
