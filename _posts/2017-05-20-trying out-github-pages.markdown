I decided to mess around with Github pages and see what I can do with it. Seems pretty flexible once I learn the ins and outs of Jekyll. It's a bit different, but really neat at the same time. The key thing is it will let me post updates on my projects as well as hosting them. The big thing is being able to use webgl in an easy and straightforward way.
