Wow, so, a lot of things broke and today I decided to fix them. When the Unreal Editor couldn't make a new project because Visual Studio was too broken, I was done letting this thorn persist. When I installed VS 2017, I had to make some symlinks because even though the installer will put Visual Studio files where you tell it to, it throws everything else on C:\ . My C:\ is a 120GB SSD. That's not gonna work. With enough pain and suffering, I found out where all these files were going and created symlinks to my 3TB drive. It was all hunky dory until Windows mysteriously broke the links. I fixed __most__ of them maybe a month ago but the VS installer still wasn't working, but that was it. I decided it would work until I found out Unreal didn't like it either.

The Linux Subsystem for Windows also managed to break itself some how. Or maybe I broke it. I really don't know. I reinstalled it and installed everything I needed for Jekyll and now it's actually working. I just really didn't want to have to break out my laptop any time I wanted to update this blog. Now I don't have to.

So yeah. That's it for now. I'm gonna try to do more updates more often later. Oh, and change this site design. It's...ok. But it's...not ok.
