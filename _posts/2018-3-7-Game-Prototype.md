I've finished a presentable prototype for my game! Right now it's just a dumb little shooter, but it's actually the first time in a long time I've put a sort of complete game flow together. It has a main menu, a play level, and a pause screen to get back to the main menu. It's not much, but I've mostly played around with idea in single level projects for a long time so it's nice to have something that more closely resembles a game rather than a toy. For now, I'm just going to throw down some links, but I want to eventually give this it's own site.

[Download Windows x64]({{site.baseurl}}/files/TDSWinx64.zip)

[WebGL Player]({{site.baseurl}}/TDSWeb/index.html)

WASD and arrow keys to move, and Escape to pause.

I've read Chrome is having some trouble with the Unity3D WebGL player as of late, so there may be some slight performance issues. I haven't tested any other browsers yet. There's one bug I know of, which will be fixed when I implement better code for pausing the game: You can still fire a bullet while the game is paused.

It might be a while before I update the game again. I have a library book on game development I need to read before it's due.
